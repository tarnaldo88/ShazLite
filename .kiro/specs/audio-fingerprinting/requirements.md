# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an audio fingerprinting application similar to Shazam. The system enables users to identify songs by recording a short audio sample, which is processed through an audio fingerprinting engine to match against a database of known tracks.

## Glossary

- **Audio_Fingerprinting_System**: The complete application including mobile/desktop frontend, backend API, and audio processing engine
- **Audio_Sample**: A 10-second digital audio recording captured by the client application
- **Audio_Fingerprint**: A unique digital signature extracted from an audio sample using spectral analysis
- **Fingerprint_Database**: PostgreSQL database storing audio fingerprints with associated song metadata
- **Client_Application**: Cross-platform Qt desktop application for audio recording and result display
- **Backend_API**: FastAPI server handling audio processing requests and database queries
- **Audio_Engine**: C++ component responsible for computing audio fingerprints from raw audio data
- **Match_Result**: Song identification result containing song name, artist, and confidence score

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a music listener, I want to record audio from my environment, so that I can identify unknown songs playing around me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user initiates recording, THE Client_Application SHALL capture exactly 10 seconds of audio data
2. THE Client_Application SHALL provide visual feedback during the recording process
3. THE Client_Application SHALL handle microphone permission requests appropriately
4. IF recording fails due to hardware issues, THEN THE Client_Application SHALL display an error message to the user
5. THE Client_Application SHALL support common audio formats for recording (WAV, MP3)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a music listener, I want the app to quickly process my recorded audio, so that I can get song identification results without long delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio recording completes, THE Client_Application SHALL transmit the Audio_Sample to the Backend_API within 2 seconds
2. WHEN the Backend_API receives an Audio_Sample, THE Audio_Engine SHALL compute the Audio_Fingerprint within 5 seconds
3. THE Backend_API SHALL search the Fingerprint_Database for matches within 3 seconds
4. THE Backend_API SHALL return Match_Result to the Client_Application within 10 seconds total processing time
5. IF processing exceeds time limits, THEN THE Backend_API SHALL return a timeout error response

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a music listener, I want to see accurate song identification results, so that I can learn about the music I'm hearing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a match is found, THE Backend_API SHALL return the song name and artist information
2. THE Backend_API SHALL include a confidence score with each Match_Result
3. WHERE multiple potential matches exist, THE Backend_API SHALL return the highest confidence match
4. THE Client_Application SHALL display the Match_Result in a clear, readable format
5. IF no match is found, THEN THE Client_Application SHALL inform the user that the song was not identified

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the audio fingerprinting to be robust and scalable, so that the system can handle multiple concurrent users effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Audio_Engine SHALL generate consistent fingerprints for the same audio content across multiple processing attempts
2. THE Fingerprint_Database SHALL support concurrent read operations from multiple Backend_API instances
3. THE Backend_API SHALL handle at least 100 concurrent fingerprinting requests
4. THE Audio_Engine SHALL process audio samples with varying quality levels and background noise
5. THE Fingerprint_Database SHALL maintain indexed fingerprint data for sub-second search performance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to have proper error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues and maintain system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Backend_API SHALL log all fingerprinting requests with timestamps and processing duration
2. WHEN errors occur in the Audio_Engine, THE Backend_API SHALL capture detailed error information
3. THE Client_Application SHALL handle network connectivity issues gracefully
4. THE Backend_API SHALL validate Audio_Sample format and size before processing
5. IF the Fingerprint_Database is unavailable, THEN THE Backend_API SHALL return appropriate error responses

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want to populate and manage the song database, so that the system can identify a comprehensive library of music.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Fingerprint_Database SHALL store song metadata including title, artist, album, and duration
2. THE Audio_Engine SHALL support batch processing of reference audio files for database population
3. THE Backend_API SHALL provide administrative endpoints for database management operations
4. THE Fingerprint_Database SHALL prevent duplicate fingerprint entries for the same song
5. THE Audio_Engine SHALL generate fingerprints from high-quality reference audio files during database setup
